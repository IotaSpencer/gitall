## GitAll

This is a Ruby+Sinatra mini-app that catches Web Based Git Services' webhooks and returns them to an IRC channel.

To use, you must first install the following gems,

```gem install recursive-open-struct sinatra cinch```

If you want to be entered into the already running hook, contact me [here](https://electrocode.net/about/contact-us/)
